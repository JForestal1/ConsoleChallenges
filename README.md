Project : ElevenFity Gold Badge Console Challenges

Build Status: Console apps 1-6 have been fully coded and tested, and I believe they satisfy all prompted functionality. With each sucessive app, more robut error handling is added, as well as a more complete set of helper methods. Each repo method has at least one unit test. 

Known Issue: I'm not entirely sure this is an issue but begining with the 3rd app, I discovered that I made an error wherein I located each project in the "ConsoleChallenges" root directory. From Github, this may make it appear that these are not all in a single Solution. The overall solution is located in the "ConsoleChallenges" folder.
